* HW1: Find placement for officers on a grid world to collect maximum activity points. Simulated annealing search algorithm was used to find placements.
* HW2: Find next applicant to be chosen by an organization to maximize space efficiency. Min-Max algorithm was used to search in the tree generated by game playing between two competing organizations.
